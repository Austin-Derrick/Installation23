H-hey...how the hell did you get here
.....
I guess it doesn't matter...you must be one of the mercenaries they sent to help out here...
You should get out of here while you can, I was a part of one of the mining teams initially sent in here. They abandoned us when the operation went south.
....Whoever sent you here will probably do the same to you.
I think I'm gonna take a nap....I'm feeling...exhausted...
